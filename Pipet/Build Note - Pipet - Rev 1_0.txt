Important notes about this version.
- One of the reverse power protection diodes was misplaced underneath where 2 of the jacks go. Follow these steps to resolve the issue.
- Add all the components to the board except the LEDs and jacks.
- Do not solder any jacks or LEDs until the end.
- Place all of the jacks onto the board (the two over the diode will be raised up about 1.5mm.
- Note that the jacks share the same hole for the ground pin.
- Place the LEDs into their respective places.
- Place the front panel over all of the jacks and tighten the nuts all the way.
- At this point some jacks will be flush with the board and some will be pulled away from the board.
- Use some tweezers or flush cut snips to leverage the jacks off the board slightly so that all look evenly spaced.
- No jacks should be touching the board at this point.
- Flip the module over and drop the LEDs into their holes.
- Solder all jacks and LEDs.
