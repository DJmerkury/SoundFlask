Important notes about this version.
- Unfortunately, the direction of the Gain Pots is reversed. Fortunately, the fix is easy. Build the module and then see the note at the very bottom.

Order of component population.
- Protection Diodes
- TL074 Opamps
- Resistors
- Capacitors
- Ring Diodes
- Electrolytic Capacitors
- Power Header
- Be sure to break off locating tab on Pot if necessary
- Place Pot and Jacks into holes (DO NOT SOLDER YET)
- Attach front Panel to Pot and Jacks
- Hand tighten Nuts (make sure everything is aligned good)
- Solder Pot and Jacks
- Tighten Nuts Completely
- Attach Knob (if needed)

The bodge fix for backward Gain Pots. You will need an Xacto knife with a new blade for this part.
- First you must cut 3 traces. The cuts must be made on the side with all of the components.
- Cut #1 is right above the middle pin on the top pot.
- Cut #2 is between the middle and right pins on the top pot.
- Cut #3 is between the middle and right pins on the bottom pot.
- Use a multimeter in continuity mode to confirm that pin 1 from IC1 is not connected to the middle pin of the top pot.
- Also check that there is no continuity between the middle and right pins of both pots.
- Now for the "fun" part. You need to scrape away the soldermask to expose a copper trace.
- The trace we want to expose is directly above where you made the first cut.
- Gently scrape the board with the edge of your blade and expose about 3 or 4 mm of trace about 3 or 4 mm above the middle pin on the top pot.
- Take a cut off resistor leg and solder one end to the exposed trace and the other end to the right pin of the top pot.
- Cut off any excess.
- Solder two more legs between the middle pin and left pin of both pots.
- Congratulations! You have bodged the board.
