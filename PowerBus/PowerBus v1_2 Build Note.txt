August 11, 2020

Important notes about this version.
- LEDs can be made less bright by increasing resistor values.
- The Faston Terminals do not need to be populated if you do not intend to use them.
- PowerBus can be used with Faston Terminals or by simply connecting a standard 16 pin power cable from a rack mounted power supply such as 4ms Row Power or Tiptop uZeus.
- Terminals are located at both ends of PowerBus board to assist with chaining PowerBus boards.
- PowerBus was originally created to go with a linear power supply that uses a transformer to step down mains voltage. Please inquire about this if you are interested.
